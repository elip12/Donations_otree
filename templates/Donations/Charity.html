            Washed Up Movie Stars Rehab Fund
        </h4>
        <p>
            Every day, dozens of actresses and actors realize they have no talent or money and have been coasting off the fame they received from acting in that movie or TV show that you watched an episode of when you were really bored that one time and can't remember the name of now because it was terrible. If you donate to our charity, you can help give these down-on-their-luck stars the second chance they need to try and become functioning adults! or more information, go to <a href="www.google.com">WUMSRF</a>.
