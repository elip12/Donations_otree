    <p>
        You are now taking part in an economics experiment, financed by the UCSC LEEPS 
        Lab. If you carefully read the following instructions, you can earn—depending on your 
        decisions during the experiment—a considerable amount of money, which will, together with 
        the show-up fee of ${{ Constants.participation_fee }}, be paid out to you in cash 
        immediately after the experiment. It is very important to read these instructions very 
        carefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        The experiment is divided into {{ Constants.num_rounds }} periods. In each period you need 
        to make a decision on the computer. After the {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decision-making 
        periods, there will be a short survey.
    </p>

    <p>
        <b>During the experiment, communication between participants is strictly forbidden</b>. 
        If you have questions, please ask us.
    </p>

        <font color=#4b82c1>Detailed Information about the Experiment</font>
    </h3>

    <p>
        Before the first decision making period, you will choose a single charity
        from a list of charities. You cannot change your charity after you have chosen it.
    </p>

    <p>
        At the beginning of each period, you will be endowed with 
        <b>${{ Constants.endowment }}</b> of real money. Your task each period is to decide how to 
        spend your endowment under different scenarios. The scenarios will include:
        <ol>
            <li>Public vs. Private donations: your donation will be visible to your friends vs. anonymous</li>
            <li>The LEEPS Lab may offer you rebates on your donations. The concept of rebate is disccused on the next page.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        You can choose to donate any amount of your endowment to your chosen
        charity organization. The remaining non-donated amount will go into 
        your personal account.
    </p>


    <p>
        In making your decisions, make sure your donation does not exceed the initial 
        endowment of <b>${{ Constants.endowment }}</b>.
        After you’ve made decisions in all 6 periods, the experimenter will 
        <b>randomly choose one period to pay out your donation decisions</b> and calculate
        the balance in your personal account. Your final payment will be your personal
        account balance plus the <b>${{ Constants.participation_fee }}</b> show-up fee.
        If you chose to donate a non-zero amount, the charity will actually receive that amount.
