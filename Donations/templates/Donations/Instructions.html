    <p>
    	You are now taking part in an economics experiment, funded by the UCSC LEEPS Lab. 
	This is a short experiment, please take your time to carefully read the instructions before making your decisions.
	By participating in this session, you will earn a ${{ Constants.participation_fee }} participation fee. 
	During the experiment, depending on your decisions, you might receive additional payoffs.
	Immediately after the experiment, your total earnings will be paid to you via Venmo.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the experiment, communication between participants will not be allowed. 
        If you have questions, please send the experimenter a private Zoom message.
    </p>


    <h3>
        <font color=#4b82c1>Specific Instructions</font>
    </h3>

    <p>
	<ol>
	    <li>
        	You will participate in a square counting task to earn your income.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		You will choose a charity of your preference from a list of six charities.
	    </li>
	    <li>
    	    	You will make eight <b>(8)</b> consecutive donation decisions.
		<ol type='a'>
		    <li>
			In each decision, you will have the opportunity to donate part of your income to the charity of your choice. 
			That is, your task is to decide how to allocate your income between the charity and your personal account.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			Each of the eight decisions will occur under <b>different</b> rules.
			Before each decision, you will be informed of the rules that apply to that particular decision. 
		    </li>
		    <li>
			Some donations will be <b>public</b> (your name and donation will be posted on the LEEPS Facebook Page and 
			will be visible to everyone).
			Some donations will be <b>private</b> (your name and donation will not be posted/shared anywhere, not even the charity).
		    </li>
		    <li>
			Some donations will receive a <b>rebate</b> (you get money back) from the LEEPS Lab. 
			Some donations will not receive any rebate. The rebate information may be public or private, depending on your donation visibility.
		    </li>
		    <li>
			At the beginning of each decision, you will always have your original balance of participation fee + task income in your cash account.
			All eight decisions are <b>independent</b>, so your money and donation from one decision will <b>NOT</b> impact or transfer to the next.
		    </li>
		</ol>
	    </li>
    	</ol>
    </p>


    <p>
	After all your {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decisions, the computer will 
        <b>randomly choose one decision and implement it</b>. That is, the donation amount you indicated in the <b>chosen</b> decision will be placed,
	and you will receive the remaining amount.
    </p>

    <p>
	Donations are real. 
	<!-- If you chose to donate a positive amount, the charity will actually receive that money. --> 
	The LEEPS Lab will add up all participants' donations and make one donation to each charity. 
	We will not mention individual names to charities when making the donations, but we will email you a receipt afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>	
	Please note that the rebate offered by LEEPS will NOT apply to donations outside of this experiment.
