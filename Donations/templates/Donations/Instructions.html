    <p>
    	You are now taking part in an economics experiment, funded by the UCSC LEEPS Lab. 
	This is a short experiment, please take your time to carefully read the instructions before making your decisions.
	By participating in this session, you will earn a ${{ Constants.participation_fee }} participation fee. 
	During the experiment, depending on your decisions, you will earn additional payoffs.
	After the experiment, your total earnings will be paid to you via Venmo immediately.
    </p>

    <p>
        During the experiment, communication between participants will not be allowed. 
        If you have questions, please send the experimenter a private Zoom message.
    </p>


    <h3>
        <font color=#4b82c1>Detailed Information about the Experiment</font>
    </h3>

    <p>
	<ol>
	    <li>
        	You will start the experiment by participating in a square counting task to earn your income.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		Then you will choose a charity from a list of charities.
	    </li>
	    <li>
		You will have the opportunity to donate some of your income to the charity of your choice in the decision-making part of the experiment, 
		but donations are not mandatory.
		We will explain concepts related to your decisions-makings before you proceed to your first decision. 
    	    </li>
    	</ol>
    </p>

    <p>
        The decision-making part of the experiment is divided into {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decisions.
	Your task is to decide how to allocate your cash account between the charity and your personal account under different scenarios. 
	The scenarios will include:
        <ol>
            <li><b>Public</b> vs. <b>Private</b> donations: your donation will be published on the LEEPS Facebook Page (visible to everyone)
		 vs. on your computer screen (visible only to you) </li>
            <li>The LEEPS Lab may offer you a <b>rebate</b> on your donations. We will discuss how rebates will be implemented later. 
	    </li>
        </ol>
    </p>

    <p>
	At the beginning of each decision, you will always have your original balance of participation fee + counting task income in your cash account.
        All {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decisions are independent, so your money and donation from one decision will not impact or transfer to the next. 
	<br>
	After all your {{ Constants.num_rounds }} decisions, the computer will 
        <b>randomly choose one decision and implement it</b>. That is, the donation you indicated in the <b>chosen</b> decision will be donated,
	and you will receive the cash you did not donate in that decision.
    </p>

    <p>
	Donations are real. 
	<!-- If you chose to donate a positive amount, the charity will actually receive that money. --> 
	The LEEPS Lab will add all participants' donations in their chosen round, and donate to the charities. 
	We will not mention individual names to charities when making the donations, but we will email you a receipt afterwards.
    </p>
    <p>	
	Please note that the rebate offered by LEEPS will NOT apply to donations outside of this experiment. 
    </p>
